**Difficulty Calibration**: We iteratively tuned tile masks and reveal budgets using pilot data to normalize difficulty across brands of varying visual complexity, introducing controlled variants to separate brand familiarity from puzzle difficulty.

**Data Quality Safeguards**: The system embedded gold-standard items, randomized tile layouts, and anti-bot heuristics, implementing outlier detection and quality flags to maintain research-grade dataset integrity.

## Technical Aspects and Platforms

**Cross-Platform Architecture**: The game featured an engine-agnostic core with shared game logic and data models abstracted from platform UI, enabling consistent rules and metrics across Facebook and iPad platforms.

**Tile-Reveal System**: A procedural mask generator produced grids and shaped partitions calibrated by logo topology, controlling the distribution of early-informative versus late-informative tiles. Heatmap instrumentation captured exact tiles removed pre-identification, enabling post-hoc salience maps highlighting brand elements most responsible for recognition.

**Performance Optimization**: The system utilized batched draw calls, dirty-rect rendering, clipped invalidation of tile regions, and pooled UI elements to maintain stable frame rates on iPad 2-class devices and within Facebook Canvas constraints of the era.

**Telemetry and Analytics**: A comprehensive event schema captured research-grade signals including timestamps, tiles-removed-to-correct ratios, inter-guess latency, confidence prompts, error taxonomy, and device metadata. An integrated A/B testing framework controlled variables like mask density, tile size, and hint cadence.

## Innovation and Market Research Gaming Impact

**Gameplay as Measurement Instrument**: Brand Bang! positioned casual puzzle gameplay as a sophisticated measurement device, yielding continuous, behavior-derived indicators superior to traditional self-report methods. Time-to-recognition and minimal-reveal thresholds served as proxies for unaided brand familiarity.

## Summary
Super Microbe World, which we developed for Public Health England in 2011, formed the core junior game within the EU‑funded e‑Bug initiative. Designed as a serious game platform for schools in the late 2000s/early 2010s, it pioneered an approach that foregrounded learning through game mechanics. Targeted at 9–12 year olds, the project used Constructive Alignment to connect classroom learning outcomes to specific in‑game actions, enabling pupils to internalize concepts about prudent antibiotic use and hand and respiratory hygiene through play. **The game was played approximately 1,700 times in the first three months of launch**, demonstrating significant early adoption. It was one of the largest serious games projects of its time, and its findings continue to be heavily cited in education and public health research.

## Educational Aims and Audience
- **Audience:** Primary pupils aged 9–12 (studies conducted with 153 pupils aged 9–11 in primary and summer schools).
- **Learning focus:** Basic principles of antimicrobial stewardship (bacteria vs. viruses and when antibiotics are appropriate), hand hygiene, and respiratory hygiene.
- **Classroom fit:** Designed to complement teacher resources and a student website featuring games and interactive activities, supporting integrated lesson delivery.

## Design and Pedagogy
- **Grounded in Constructive Alignment:** Each level and mechanic was deliberately mapped to explicit learning outcomes. Game verbs (what players do) were chosen to instantiate curricular objectives rather than overlaying quizzes on top of gameplay.
- **Mechanic‑first research inversion:** The project explicitly inverted typical serious‑games approaches by starting with mechanics that embody target concepts, then iteratively validating learning through classroom use.
- **Iterative co‑design in schools:** We spent most of our time visiting schools, working with teachers and pupils and iteratively crafting experiences that could help in classrooms.
- **Level structure:** A five‑level platform game, with each level associated with a defined set of learning objectives and feedback loops aligning performance with understanding.

![Evil Machines Screenshot 1](2005_evil_machines_screenshot1.jpg)

![Evil Machines Screenshot 2](2005_evil_machines_screenshot2.jpg)

## Summary
- An isometric, turn-based multiplayer strategy game with gameplay comparable to XCOM and Laser Squad Nemesis.
- Widely cited as the first cross-platform game to support seamless play between PC and mobile devices.
- Our first real game developed by David Farrell and the first real game we delivered as the team that later formed our company.

## Recognition
- Winner, Dare to be Digital competition, 2005.

## Development Overview
- **Timeline:** 12 weeks.
- **Team:** This was the first game we worked on together; two of us collaborated before our company was formally established and have continued to work together since.
- **Goal:** Achieve feature-parity multiplayer strategy gameplay across PC web and early mobile hardware in an era before cross-platform engines or services existed.

## Platforms and Modes
- **PC:** Web-based client.
- **Mobile:** Java mobile application (e.g., compatible with Nokia-era devices).
- **Play model:** Turn-based; players could take their turns on either platform, with a shared, authoritative game state.

## Key Innovations
- **Cross-platform parity:** Delivered the same core gameplay loop on two fundamentally different technology stacks at the same time, establishing a new model for multi-device play.
- **Runtime palette swapping:** Invented a lightweight method to visually differentiate teams on memory-constrained devices by changing color palettes at runtime instead of loading separate sprite sets.
- **Mobile-first strategy UX:** Designed an interface for strategic play on early mobile phones, where screen size, input methods, and processing power were significant constraints.
- **Server-authoritative architecture:** Centralized rules and state management to ensure consistency across platforms, enabling reliable cross-device turns.

## Technical Architecture
- **Web architecture for cross-platform play:** A server mediated all interactions, ensuring that both the PC web client and the mobile Java app operated against the same game state.
- **Data flow:** Clients submitted turn instructions to a backend using server-side SQL queries and processing logic; the server validated, resolved, and persisted results before broadcasting updates.
- **Thin-client design:** Clients focused on input, rendering, and state display, while game logic and rule resolution occurred on the server to guarantee determinism across platforms.
- **Resource optimization:** Addressed severe memory limits on mobile devices by minimizing asset footprints, employing palette swaps, and carefully managing loading to avoid exceeding device capabilities.

## Development Challenges
When mobile strategy gameplay was still largely uncharted, we relied on iterative UX prototypes tuned to keypad input, small screens, and short sessions, pairing them with clean, isometric visuals optimized for quick readability. To ensure identical play across a heterogeneous device landscape, we moved rule execution to the server and implemented a database-backed turn system so outcomes stayed unified and free of platform-specific quirks. Finally, because tight memory budgets ruled out unique art for every player, we differentiated teams through runtime palette swaps and extensive sprite reuse, delivering variety without increasing the footprint.

## Impact and Legacy
- Established a working pattern for cross-platform, turn-based multiplayer years before mainstream engines and services supported it.
- Demonstrated that PC and mobile clients could share a single, authoritative game state with consistent mechanics and user experience.
- Laid the technical and collaborative foundation for our subsequent work; the partnership formed during this project continued as our company evolved.

## Notable Firsts
- Our first real game developed as the team that became our company.
- Widely recognized as the first cross-platform game operating simultaneously across PC web and mobile phone technologies.
