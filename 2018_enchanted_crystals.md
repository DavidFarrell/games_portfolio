## Summary

Enchanted Crystals (2018) is an educational mobile game we developed that strengthens mental maths fluency for European pupils within a Harry Potter-inspired fantasy setting. Developed under an EU Erasmus grant, we pioneered a gesture-based math input system that allows students to draw numbers and mathematical operations (like "3 × 5") directly on the screen, replacing traditional keypad entry with intuitive gestures. Delivered through an international collaboration with a German serious-games partner and teachers from Germany, Scotland, Portugal, and Greece, the title earned Best Mobile Game and 2nd Overall Prize at the 7th International Educational Games Competition.

## Development Details

**Funding and Scope:** Supported by the EU Erasmus programme to advance cross-border educational innovation and disseminate open practices in digital learning.

**Partnership Model:** Co-development with a serious games company in Germany and educator panels from Germany, Scotland, Portugal, and Greece. Teachers co-authored learning objectives, task types, and formative assessment routines.

**Co-design and Iteration:** Structured development cycles combined remote production with in-classroom pilots in partner countries. Teacher workshops and learner observations informed mechanics tuning, gesture vocabulary refinements, and content progression.

**Compliance and Data Practices:** Designed with privacy-by-default principles suitable for minors and European contexts. Anonymized play telemetry and in-app consent patterns supported ethical classroom research and iteration.

**Production Approach:** A cross-platform mobile build with content modularization to support localization, curriculum alignment per country, and rapid iteration on task templates without requiring client updates.

## Core Innovation

The game's central innovation was its gesture-based math input system, where students could draw numbers and mathematical operations (such as "3 × 5") directly on the screen using natural gestures instead of using traditional keypads. This approach reduced cognitive overhead and made mathematical expression more intuitive and immediate for young learners.

## Educational Impact

**Curriculum Alignment:** Tasks target mental calculation strategies emphasized in European curricula (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decomposition, partitioning, and estimation), enabling relevance across partner countries.

**Reduced Input Friction:** By allowing pupils to "think with their fingers," the gesture system minimizes cost of entry, helps maintain working-memory focus on number relationships, and shortens the loop between strategy selection and answer expression.

**Teacher Co-ownership:** Educators directly influenced task design, error messaging, and scaffolding, improving classroom fit and construct validity. The co-design model supported practical concerns such as lesson timing, device variability, and classroom management.

**International Classroom Pilots:** Iterations were informed by observations in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, exposing edge cases early (e.g., symbol conventions, numeral forms) and strengthening the generalizability of the input vocabulary and learning sequences.

**Recognition:** Awards at the 7th International Educational Games Competition validated both usability and pedagogical soundness, with Best Mobile Game and 2nd Overall Prize highlighting cross-criteria excellence.

## Significance

Enchanted Crystals demonstrates how human–computer interaction research can materially enhance core skills acquisition in education. Our gesture-based math input system offers a replicable alternative to keypad-centric design, showing that embodied, low-latency interactions can reduce cognitive overhead and increase engagement in mental arithmetic. 

Equally, we modeled a scalable international co-design process: educators and developers collaborating across countries to produce content that is both technically robust and pedagogically grounded. Our work advances best practices for:

- Child-robust gesture recognition and confidence-driven fallbacks on commodity mobile hardware
- Authorable, context-aware input grammars that tie directly to learning objectives
- Cross-border curriculum alignment and ethical data practices suitable for classrooms

By coupling novel input technology with a richly themed fantasy world and rigorous educational co-design, Enchanted Crystals contributes a distinctive, award-winning approach to serious games for mathematics education.
