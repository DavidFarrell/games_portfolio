# Gaming Climate Futures: Earth Remembers

![Gaming Climate Futures](2018_gaming_climate_futures_main_project.jpg)

## Summary

Gaming Climate Futures (2018) is a climate policy simulation we developed with Glasgow Caledonian University students for UN decision makers that operationalizes the relationship between global temperature targets and climate tipping points. Delivered as a mixed-media workshop—combining game mechanics, structured negotiations, storytelling, and co-creation—it functions as a decision-support and learning tool to deepen understanding of systemic climate risks while strengthening diplomatic communication. The project was nominated for Best Game at the 2019 International Educational Games Competition.

## Development Context and Objectives

We developed it to support sessions at the UN Climate Change Conference, addressing a dual need: to convey the non-linear dynamics of climate tipping points and to improve the quality of international climate dialogue under time and information constraints. Objectives included:

- Translating complex scientific knowledge about tipping cascades into actionable, shared reference points for negotiators
- Stress-testing diplomatic strategies against systemic risk, uncertainty, and path dependence
- Establishing innovative co-production between scientists and decision makers to align models, assumptions, and policy framings
- Enhancing communication across diverse stakeholder groups through common experiential frames

## Technical Approach and Innovative Aspects

**Mixed-media serious game design:** A modular toolkit integrates facilitated role-play, scenario cards, negotiation protocols, and narrative prompts with a technology-supported engagement process for real-time input capture, aggregation, and feedback.

**Tipping-point-informed mechanics:** Game states and payoffs incorporate thresholds and non-linear transitions, making the consequences of surpassing temperature targets legible within the negotiation space (e.g., escalating risks, loss of options, cascading impacts).

**Procedural mapping of policy to risk:** Players' commitments (mitigation, finance, adaptation) are procedurally linked to trajectories that update collective risk levels, foregrounding trade-offs and the timing of action.

**Co-creation workflow:** Our iterative design sprints with scientific experts and policy practitioners ensured evidence-aligned parameters and face validity for diplomatic contexts; the process itself is an innovation in knowledge co-production.

**Facilitation and analytics:** Structured debriefs and lightweight data tools support reflection on strategy, trust formation, and communication patterns, converting gameplay traces into shared learning artifacts.

## Impact and Significance

**Policy-relevant fidelity without overcomplexity:** Our design balances scientific credibility with usability for high-level, time-boxed workshops, offering a replicable model for evidence-based policy gaming.

**Demonstrated uptake at international fora:** Deployed to facilitate UN Climate Change Conference workshops, the game showed that serious games can productively inform discussions among senior decision makers.

**Recognition of excellence:** Nomination for Best Game at the 2019 International Educational Games Competition validated both the design quality and educational impact.

**Methodological benchmark:** We advanced participatory modeling and stakeholder engagement practices, illustrating how mixed-media formats and technology-supported processes can translate complex systems into collective, actionable insight.

## Unique Contributions to Climate Communication and Policy Gaming

**Innovative co-production approach:** We embedded scientists and negotiators within a shared design and play environment, aligning mental models and surfacing assumptions that often remain implicit in formal talks.

**Making tipping points experiential:** Converts abstract thresholds into tangible strategic constraints and narrative consequences, improving comprehension and recall.

**Bridging quantitative targets and human narratives:** Integrates data-driven dynamics with storytelling to foster empathy, trust, and cross-cultural dialogue—critical assets in multilateral negotiations.

**Structured communication training:** The negotiation protocol doubles as a communication scaffold, improving clarity, listening, and coalition-building under uncertainty.

**Portable engagement architecture:** A modular, technology-supported format allows adaptation to different conference settings and stakeholder mixes while maintaining core learning objectives.

## Research Impact and Findings

The project generated significant academic research, resulting in peer-reviewed publications examining the game's effectiveness:

**Published Research:**

- van Beek, L., Milkoreit, M., Vervoort, J.M., Prokopy, L., Lenton, T., Weiner, R., Reed, J.B., Farrell, D., Wardekker, A. (2022). "The effects of serious gaming on risk perceptions of climate tipping points." *Climatic Change*, 170, 31.

**Key Research Findings:**
- **Reduced psychological distance:** The game made climate tipping points more 'real', proximate and tangible for participants, improving comprehension of abstract climate risks
- **Enhanced risk perception:** Participants demonstrated increased concern about climate tipping points after gameplay
- **Effective science-policy interface:** The simulation proved valuable as a tool for engaging high-level climate negotiators and non-governmental observers
- **Knowledge co-production success:** The project demonstrated how games can bridge scientific knowledge and policy-making processes

**UN Implementation:** Successfully deployed at the 2018 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change subsidiary bodies meeting in Bonn, Germany, with up to 30 participants simulating negotiations that projected Earth's state 25-100 years in the future. Delegates described the workshops as providing "emotionally resonant and actionable insights" and a "refreshing yet insightful break from tense climate negotiations."

Together, these contributions position Gaming Climate Futures as a significant advance in climate policy simulation—demonstrating how serious game design, mixed-media engagement, and knowledge co-production can meaningfully support high-stakes international decision making.
