## Summary

cf.me set out to change the way people get daily news by blending editorial content with playful, habitual interactions. The company later rebranded as Shades News. We were engaged to design a cohesive experience across the website and mobile app. We designed two iOS games that could act as lightweight, daily touchpoints. "baw" and "wurd" were conceived as quick, replayable titles that complement reading sessions—offering snackable play during news breaks and providing new entry points back into the news experience. This work established a foundation for a news platform where games are not an add-on, but a core retention and engagement mechanic.

## Development Details

**Experience Architecture:** Defined a unified engagement loop spanning the website, the news app, and the two games. Users could move fluidly from headlines to play and back via in-app surfaces, deep links, and cross-promotional hooks.

**Product Integration:** Contributed to the cf.me website and iOS app alongside owning the games to ensure a shared design language, consistent interaction patterns, and discoverability of play within the news flow.

**Games-as-onramp:** Delivered two iOS titles—"baw" and "wurd"—as low-friction, pick‑up‑and‑play experiences designed for short sessions. The games were positioned as daily rituals that could introduce users to the brand and bring them back for news updates.

**Iterative Development:** Prototyped UX flows and game loops quickly, validating how and where play fits into a news habit (entry points, session timing, notifications, and rewards).

**Content and Community Surfaces:** Implemented in-app placements and shareable moments so successes in games could translate into social and in-product visibility, driving organic discovery.
